## Motivation

In short, I was fed up with how the job application process was going. I was a former educator in the inner-city of San Francisco teaching primary grades for the past 2 years and was looking to make a switch into tech. I always had a passion for data and analytics which naturally led me to do a bootcamp in Data Science with Galvanize. Why a bootcamp? I thought the skills I needed to land a job in data science / data analytics could be learned at the bootcamp which would be sufficient as base point to get my *first job* in tech. Yes and no. With over 400+ job applications sent out, ~30 of those being referrals, 75+ rejections, and ~17 callbacks, I decided to embark on a project that would *expand my job search* beyond my normal friend circle. 

I have heard of people using Linkedin to randomly message users to solicit a date, most definitely creepy and unprofessional to say the least. In the spirit of going counter culture to something that isn't really Linkedin culture, I decided to use python to build a bot to make connections on a dating platform to increase my circle of possibility. 

### Question

Could I get ANY referrals from dating platforms?
Would this be worth my time?
